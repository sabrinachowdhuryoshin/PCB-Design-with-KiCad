## Getting Started

To access the PCB designs, clone the repository using the following command:

`git clone https://github.com/sabrinachowdhuryoshin/PCB-Designing-with-KiCad.git`

The repository contains multiple folders, each containing a separate PCB design project.

## Usage

To open and edit a PCB design project, open the corresponding folder in KiCad software. Each project contains a `.pro` file, which is the main project file, and `kicad_pcb file`, which is the PCB layout file.

The repository also contains the generated Gerber files, which are used for manufacturing the PCB. These files are located in the `Gerber` folder of each project.

## Contributing

Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you want to contribute a new PCB design, create a new folder with the project name and add the necessary files. Ensure that the files are compatible with the latest version of KiCad software.

Before submitting a pull request, make sure to test the design and generate the Gerber files to ensure that everything is working properly.
